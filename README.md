# Superhero-Hunter
I have made this Superhero Hunter website using HTML, CSS and JS.Marvel Api was used for making this website.
<h2>Some features are listed below:-</h2>
1. Displayed a list of SuperHeros (Characters) on the home page. Also created a search bar that will filter out the character based on search query.Atleast two characters needed in the search bar to show option list of Superheros.

2. You can add and remove the Superheros from your favourite Superhero list.
